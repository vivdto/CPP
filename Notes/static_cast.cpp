/*
In C++, static_cast is a casting operator used to perform conversions between compatible types. It allows you to perform explicit type conversions in a safe and controlled manner.

Here are some common use cases of static_cast:

Converting Between Related Types: You can use static_cast to convert between related types, such as converting from int to float, or from a pointer to a base class to a pointer to a derived class.
cpp
Copy code
int x = 10;
float y = static_cast<float>(x);
Converting Enumerations: You can use static_cast to convert an enumeration type to an integer type, or vice versa.
cpp
Copy code
enum class Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };
int colorValue = static_cast<int>(Color::RED);
Converting Pointers: You can use static_cast to convert pointers between related types, such as from a pointer to a derived class to a pointer to a base class, or vice versa.
cpp
Copy code
class Base {};
class Derived : public Base {};

Base* basePtr = new Derived();
Derived* derivedPtr = static_cast<Derived*>(basePtr);
Type Punning: You can use static_cast to reinterpret the binary representation of an object as a different type. However, this usage should be done with caution and awareness of potential undefined behavior.
cpp
Copy code
int intValue = 42;
float floatValue = static_cast<float>(intValue); // Type punning
Unlike C-style casts, static_cast performs a compile-time check to ensure type safety. It's recommended to use static_cast whenever possible, as it provides better readability and type safety compared to C-style casts. However, it's important to note that static_cast can only perform conversions that are considered safe by the compiler. If you need to perform more dangerous conversions or circumvent type safety checks, you might resort to other casting operators like reinterpret_cast or const_cast.
