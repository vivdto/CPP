Embark on a journey into the realm of matrices in data structures and algorithms, where their elegant manipulation and efficient operations will revolutionize your problem-solving skills and elevate your programming prowess. In this section we will discuss: Passing 2D Arrays as Arguments in C++


 
There are various ways to pass a 2D Array as Argument to a Function. The methods are as follows:

Specifying both row and col size
Passing just the col size
Globally declaring the row and col size
Using Double Pointer Method
Using Array of Pointers Method
Using Array of Vectors Method
Using Vector of Vectors Method
The video discusses and shows the implementation of the above methods.
