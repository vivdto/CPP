/* Embark on a journey into the realm of matrices in data structures and algorithms, where their elegant manipulation and efficient operations will revolutionize your problem-solving skills and elevate your programming prowess. In this section we will discuss: Introduction to Multidimensional Array in C++

A multi-dimensional array can be termed as an array of arrays that stores homogeneous data in tabular form. Data in multidimensional arrays is generally stored in row-major order in the memory.



Example:                                              2D Array
