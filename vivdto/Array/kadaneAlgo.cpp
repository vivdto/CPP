/*As Kadaneâ€™s algorithm requires atleast one positive integer to produce the right input


Kadane's Algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm. It calculates the maximum sum subarray ending at a particular position by using the maximum sum subarray ending at the previous position. Don't worry you will learn about Dynamic Programming later in this course.
