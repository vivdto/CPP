/* Vectors --> sequence containers!


Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can
change in size.


Just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for
their elements, which means that their elements can also be
accessed directly in O(1) time.


But unlike arrays, their size can change dynamically, with their
storage being handled automatically by the container.


--> Using Vector Container!

Vector --> (size 4)
we need a size 6; 
vector will get doubled --> size 8!

then suppose we need 9 size 
it will be 3XVector -- of 12 size

old array/vector is deleted.
and all elements gets transfered into the new array/vector.

--> Push_Back(data) O(1) / O(N) - Time Complexity.
